# About the Z Compiler
# Important

The compiler is not the priority of this project (at this moment).
Until the design is completely done and tested the priority is the design.
The compiler doesn't (nor needs to) reflect the exact design, so there might be some sideeffects that might look like a feature but aren't.

It's only made for the purpose of testing some ideas and start trying out 
some design desicions (though those could be tested by simply writting test cases).

One good reason is to have it as a "prototype" of the final compiler.
Python as a language allows for quick changes, and this is really time saver for
this kind of project.

At any case it should be considered to be made "just for the lulz".
My time is extremely limited so this is really just one (not so) big hack, 
made in one (not so) big hurry.
It's not academic (by any means), nor correct, much less efficient or elegant.

Please don't judge it as such.

But please consider to help us out to make a correct one.
