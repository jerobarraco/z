Functions, so called procedures, i rather call them functions.
# Proposal 1: Denominator
	def like python
	def f(....):
		Not bad, def is not intuitive enough
	
	f to be short
	f F(....):
		shorter, but not good to read
	
	func 
	func f(....):
		more intuitive not too long
		"fun" can also be used,also it's a reference to Fun
	
	no symbol, like in C
	f(...):
		no fucking way, this by itself creates many confusions
